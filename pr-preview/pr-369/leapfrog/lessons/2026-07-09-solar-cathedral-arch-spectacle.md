# Solar CP2 — the "M-not-V" cathedral arch + withheld-regalia coronation ladder

**What we did.** Solar's Eternal apex "lacked the spectacle of an end-game dragon" from the
REAR-CHASE cam (the primary view): the four forms were the same dragon at four sizes, the apex was
inert (dead-black, flat maroon wing wall), and the rear silhouette read a spiked delta-KITE (a V),
not a monarch. CP2 fixed all three in `dragonSovereign.js` + the `solar.forms` ladder in
`dragons.js`.

**The wow move — silhouette is a FUNCTION, not a mesh.** The V came from the wing's vertical profile
being LINEAR (`y = t*0.30 + x*tan(dih)` → two flat ramps, nothing above the head). The whole monarch
read is one function swap: a two-segment **gull arch** (`wingArchY(t, halfSpan, dih, archRise)`) that
climbs steeply to a **carpal apex at t≈0.35** then descends — plus one dominant **carpal lance** per
wing at that apex (~2.6× the rank pikes). Twin spires break the skyline ABOVE the crown and FRAME the
corona ring, head enthroned in the valley → **M, not V**. The rank pikes were then DEMOTED outboard
with a steeper `0.62^i` decay so the wing reads LANCE→step→step→tip (a scale hierarchy), not a picket
fence of equals. Net cost ~repositioning, not tris (Eternal 1646→2010).

**The gotcha that bites every arch/dihedral change: the FX handles use their OWN copy of the
profile formula.** The wingtip trails + hard-bank aero-shear read `parts.tipMarker*` / `wingElements`
tip positions, which were hardcoded to the OLD `0.30 + halfSpan*tan(dih)`. If you move the geometry
and forget these, the trails detach from where the tip actually is. Fix: make the profile a
**module-level shared function** and call it from BOTH the vault geometry AND the marker/wingElements
push. (Same shape as any "two places compute the same position" bug — hoist the formula.)

**Blend, don't replace, for backward-compatible dials.** `wingArchY` fades the old linear dihedral
out as `archRise` fades in (`x*tan(dih)*(1-archRise) + arch*archRise`), so `archRise:0` is
byte-identical to the old princeling glide and the Hatchling keeps its flat delta. The ladder then
just dials `archRise` 0→0.35→0.7→1.0.

**Withheld regalia is what makes a ladder rank-able.** The old forms all wore the full crown, so
Eternal conferred nothing. CP2 GATES each regalia piece to a rung: `igniteStage` 0/1/2/3 (which
emissives are lit), `starGemBloom` 0→1 (the brow gem is ABSENT on the whelp — gate the mesh on
`bloom>0`, not just dim it), `coronaValleys>0` (no mantle collar until Radiant), `napeStar` from
Radiant, `coronaRing`/`sparTipHeat` Eternal-only. Now every form adds **light AND hardware AND more
arch** — visibly rank-able from behind. Tris monotonic 967<1302<1611<2010 is the cheap proxy the
starters test asserts.

**Anti-tacky glow doctrine held: eclipse-BY-CONSTRUCTION.** The corona is a DARK opaque 12-facet
flat-shaded annulus (`flatTriMesh`, NO torus) wearing a THIN saturated bicolour rim — a dark
moon-disk, not a smoky additive halo. That is both the premium look AND the reason it can't be
mistaken for pearl's soft halo sprite (the Fable collision veto). Same rule everywhere: saturated
emissive baked into opaque facets (sat≥0.75, value≤0.9) blooms in-colour under ACES; the ONLY
near-white elements are the tiny f3 spar tips, kept OUT of every `spineMats` array so Surge can't
detonate them to white.

**Rearward sigil for a rear-primary cam.** The brow star-gem faces AWAY from the chase cam, so the
king needed a second star the rear view actually reads — a violet `napeStar` octahedron on the
mantle crest (net-new; flag for owner approval since it's a new silhouette element).

**The bright band must FACE the camera, not sit edge-on to it.** First corona build put the
saturated violet/amber rim on the annulus's thin *depth-edge* band — which is edge-on to a
rear-chase cam, so it read as a near-invisible dark hoop (Fable round-1: "a cathedral without its
rose window"). Fix: split the *front* (camera-facing) face radially — inner dark moon-disk +
an OUTER saturated rim band [Rm..Ro] — so the glow faces the viewer. General rule for any
emissive-rim motif on a primary-view cam: put the lit facets on the face the camera sees, and size
the lit band for pixel area at gameplay distance, not just intensity. (Two Fable rounds took this
from 3.77 → 4.13 PASS; the other round-2 fixes were a lit dorsal "spine of light" so the black-body
center isn't a void, and seating tip/tail jewels at ~0.9× blade length so they read welded not
floating — a centred octahedron at the exact 1.0 tip of a point-narrow spike leaves a silhouette gap.)

**Verify.** `tricount` 4 forms <6000 · `wingsymprobe solar` PASS (arch/lances are mirror-built, so
symmetry is free) · `starters.mjs` +20 solar asserts (igniteStage/gem-radius/coronaRing-f3-only/
arch/carpal/nape monotonic; motif-anchor waived at f0) · blueprint + smoke green · `dragonstudio
solar r-cp2` rear silhouette reads M. Solar reaches Eternal (SSSR), so it needs its OWN test block —
the shared starters SPECS loop hard-asserts `maxTierFor===2` (starters cap at Radiant).

**What it unlocks.** A reusable pattern for "same dragon at N sizes" → a real coronation ladder:
(1) make the silhouette a blended function keyed by a 0→1 dial, (2) gate each regalia MESH (not just
its brightness) to a rung, (3) assert tris + dial monotonicity as the rank-ability proxy.
