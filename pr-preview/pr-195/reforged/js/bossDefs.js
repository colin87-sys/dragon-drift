// Boss definitions — data, not code. A boss is hp + a procedural model recipe +
// an ordered list of phases, each with its own attack set and fire cadence. The
// controller (boss.js) resolves attack ids to bullet patterns, so adding a boss
// is (mostly) authoring a new entry here. Tuning numbers default from CONFIG.BOSS.
//
// Phase `atFrac` is the hp fraction at which that phase BEGINS (1.0 = full hp).
// `attacks` are pattern ids understood by boss.js:
//   aimed  — three bullets near your position (precision sidestep, REFLECTABLE)
//   fan    — a wide spread across the lane (find the gap, REFLECTABLE)
//   spiral — an instant radial burst that flies outward
//   tunnel — a succession of bullet-rings rushing at you; weave the moving centre
//   spiralStream — a rotating emitter, arms sweeping around (read the spin)
//   curtain — a full 2D wall minus one safe lane placed away from you (commit early)
//   movingGap — timed wall rows whose gap slides sideways (track it in time)
//   iris — contracting rings; the safe zone shrinks to the centre (the showpiece)
//   stream — a tracking hose re-aiming at your live position (peel away in an arc)
//   secondWave — a spread, then a half-gap-offset spread where you dodged to
//   crossfire — two flanking emitters converge aimed spreads (REFLECTABLE)
// Pattern JOBS (danmaku design): fills deny the plane (camp-proof), anti-flee
// punishes a single relocation, garnish layers aimed shots on a structure.
// Difficulty escalates by unlocking streamed patterns + tightening cadence —
// never by raw bullet count (mobile visibleCap; density reads as unfair).
// `accent`/`glow` colour the boss BODY; `bulletColor` is the magenta danger colour.
// `constrictPhase`: phase index at which the arena walls slam in (showpiece).
