# 🐸^🐸 Leapfrog Studios — `leapfrog^leapfrog`

This is the studio playbook and **append-only lessons ledger** for Dragon Drift.

## The ideology

> Every step we take, we extract the lesson and write it down here, so the **next
> session starts from everything the last one learned — and leapfrogs from there**.
> Compounding knowledge across sessions, not just within one. Leapfrog, to the
> power of leapfrog.

A fresh chat with zero memory of past work can read this file and immediately
operate at the level we've already reached — then push past it, and record *its*
lessons for the one after. That is the whole studio: we rapidly improve the game
**and ourselves**.

## ▶ HANDOFF — read this FIRST to pick up where the last session left off

You are a fresh session continuing **Dragon Drift** (the `reforged/` rewrite). Read this
file top-to-bottom: **this HANDOFF** (where we are) → the **Active roadmap** (the next big
build) → **THE RULE** + the **lessons ledger L1–L10** (how we work + everything learned so
far). Then continue — and **append a lesson after every meaningful change**.

### Where we are (state of the world)
- **Live work:** PR **#107**, branch `claude/game-graphics-review-q22iuh`. Deployed preview:
  `https://colin87-sys.github.io/dragon-drift/pr-preview/pr-107/` (the root `index.html`
  redirects to the `reforged/` build, which is the real game now). **The human judges ALL
  visuals on that preview — there is no WebGL in CI** (the Chromium CDN is blocked by the
  network policy), so headless tools (`tricount`, `run-all`) are the only automated checks;
  everything visual is human-verified on the PR. Commit + push to the branch → the preview
  auto-rebuilds; respond to its `<github-webhook-activity>` events.
- **What just shipped — the SHOP/MENU is now a "real-world hero scene".** The shop renders
  the **real game environment** (the tuned sky + shader-water + god-rays + post-FX pipeline)
  behind a transparent HUD — *exactly what the start screen already does* — with the
  inspected dragon swapped in on browse, a **static** hero camera, and the loose gameplay FX
  (collectible rings + the dragon's flight trail) hidden for a clean shot. It is **fully
  decoupled from the run** (no player teleport, no obstacle culling, no render-gate hacks),
  so the long "walls vanish / embers leak / crash-pose freeze / no-UI" bug parade is dead at
  the root. **Read L9 and L10 below — they are the hard-won core of this.**
- **Key shop files (`reforged/js/`):** `ui.js` (shop opens the real env behind a transparent
  `.shop-screen`; `wireHeroSelect` browse → `handlers.onPreviewDragon` swaps only the
  dragon; the `atShop()` flag = `lastScreen==='shop' && screen visible`), `main.js` (the
  `hideShopFx = ui.atShop() && game.state !== 'playing'` FX hide — **the `!== 'playing'`
  guard is the seatbelt that makes it structurally impossible to hide a wall mid-run** — and
  the `atShop` static-camera flag), `cameraController.js` (`shopMode` static framing),
  `dragon.js` (`setDragonFxVisible`), `rings.js` (`setRingsVisible`). The old inspect-modal
  (`preview.js` DragonShowcase + `showcaseBackdrop.js`) still exists but is no longer the
  shop's main view; `menuStage.js` (a hand-rolled fake backdrop) was tried and **deleted**
  (see L10 — reuse the real engine, don't reinvent it).

### Open items / next steps (in priority order)
1. **Confirm the walls hold** on the latest build (pause→shop→swap→resume; crash→shop→
   restart) — that was the last thing the user was verifying.
2. **Astral biome for the shop (DEFERRED, do carefully):** the user likes the cosmos/astral
   biome for the menu. The naive "feed the env the astral distance" approach **displaces the
   biome props** (they recycle *forward* past the player and the recycler never pulls them
   back) — that was a real wall-class regression. The clean fix is a **colour-only biome
   override inside `environment.js`**: decouple the palette distance (`computeEnv` /
   `updateEnvironment` ~line 429) from the prop-recycling distance (`recycleBand`). Caveats:
   it gives an astral *sky* over the *real biome's* props, and the **paused** shop freezes
   the env (its render gate `if (game.state !== 'paused')` is skipped). Theme via COLOUR,
   never via world displacement.
3. **Pop / composition** tuning for the hero shot (rim separation per dragon, framing so the
   stats panel never covers the body).
4. **THE BIG ONE — the Creature Modeling roadmap below.** This is the next major frontier and
   was the original north-star before the shop detour.

### The one law that took ~20 rounds to learn (don't relearn it)
**A menu is the real game world, reframed + frozen — never a mutated or reinvented one.**
Reuse the rendering pipeline (it's tuned + on-brand + free); decouple **STATE** (never modify
the run / obstacles / player), not **RENDERING**; touch only the *subject* (the dragon). Any
"hide gameplay element for the menu" MUST be `.visible`-only and hard-gated by
`game.state !== 'playing'` so it can never affect a live run.

## 🗺 Active roadmap — Creature Modeling ("Organism" tech): current state + what remains

> **The wing-seam "organism" FOUNDATION is already built and proven on the hero.** What
> remains is rolling it across the roster + a detail/ULTRA tier + a couple of un-built
> pillars. (An older written plan proposed building `modelDetail`/`dragonSurface`/`skinDeform`/
> `creatureShader` from scratch — that plan is **STALE**: the seam fix actually shipped via
> curved/skinned membrane *recipes* + the surface-shader system instead. Trust the code +
> the L1–L8 lessons below, not that plan.)

### Already DONE (the foundation — see L1–L8)
- **The wing seam is fixed by construction.** `dragonParts.js#buildCurvedPatch` builds a smooth
  **double-curved** membrane (spanwise arc + chordwise billow). Wing recipes coexist via the
  registry (`dragonRecipe.js`): `'membrane'` (legacy flat, the fallback), `'curvedMembrane'`
  (curved patch), **`'skinnedMembrane'`** (ONE continuous `SkinnedMesh` on shoulder→elbow→wrist
  bones — the deep organism fix, no crease), `'feather'`, `'none'`.
- **Proven on the hero:** **Obsidian** already runs `parts: { wings: 'skinnedMembrane',
  surface: { shader: ['cellularScales','iridescence'] } }` (`dragons.js:208`) — seamless skinned
  wing + procedural surface detail, in budget, rig contract intact. Phase-0/1 of the old plan
  is effectively done.
- **Surface shader system** (`dragonSurfaceShader.js`, L4): composable `onBeforeCompile` patches
  (`fresnelRimPatch`/`cellularScales`/`iridescence`/`membraneSSS`) via `composeSurface`.
- **Flap-as-data** (`dragonWingFlap.js`, L5), **recipe/registry + attach contract**
  (`dragonRecipe.js`), per-form feel (L7). Rig contract frozen (below).

### What REMAINS (the actual next work, in order)
1. **Migrate the roster (the L8 "perfect-hero → mechanize" payoff).** Only Obsidian is on
   `skinnedMembrane` + surface shaders; the other ~13 dragons still default to the flat
   `'membrane'` (`dragonRecipe.js:64`). Roll each onto `curvedMembrane`/`skinnedMembrane`
   (keeping its `wingSpec` silhouette) + opt-in surface shaders, with `'membrane'` as the
   per-dragon fallback until proven. Write the "Obsidian → any dragon" migration checklist as
   a ledger artifact so the rollout is mechanical, not re-derived.
2. **Phoenix polish + a reusable `shingle()` generator** (overlapping curved cards = the Phoenix
   feather trick, generalized to scales/plates/fins on any creature) — NOT built yet. Cupped/
   curved feathers + webs on `buildCurvedPatch`.
3. **Model-detail LOD / ULTRA tier — NOT built.** There is NO geometry LOD today
   (`setDragonQuality` only scales particle rates; segment counts are hardcoded low — cones
   4–8, spheres 6–14). Add `modelDetail.js` (`LOW/HIGH/ULTRA`, default HIGH = today, no
   regression), make low-level helpers detail-aware (`wingStrut`/`bone`/`featherGeo` read a
   `seg()` picker), thread `opts.detail` through `buildDragonModel(def, opts)`, auto-select by
   render tier (tier0→ULTRA on a 17 Pro Max), a `MODEL DETAIL` Settings seg-row
   (AUTO/HIGH/ULTRA, mirror the GRAPHICS QUALITY pattern), and a ~4s sustained rebuild gate
   (`rebuildDragon` only in menus/at death, never under the active camera). This is what makes
   "more tris on high-end" pay off — the GPU is idle, the bottleneck is CPU/JS, and the skinned
   membrane already animates high-poly on the GPU for ~free.
4. **`sweepProfile()` (spline-swept bodies/necks/tails/horns) — NOT built.** Generalizes the
   torso loft so future creatures animate by *bending a curve*, not rotating segments — the
   path to many non-dragon creatures from one technique.

### Frozen rig contract (do NOT break — every wing builder obeys it)
Return `{ group, parts: { wingPivotL/R, wingTipL/R, wingPivot2L/R, tipMarkerL/R }, wingMat,
spineMats }` with `wingTip` a child of `wingPivot`. `dragon.js` writes `wingPivot*.rotation`
(flap) + `wingTip*.rotation` (wrist fold ±0.28 rad); `tipMarker*` is read for trail spawn. New
handles are additive + nullable (the `'none'` builder is the template). Never rename/restructure.

### Verification (all in `reforged/`)
`node tools/tricount.mjs` (per-form budget 6000; roster ≈ 89k tris, 0 over); `tests/run-all.mjs`
+ `tests/skinnedwing.mjs` + `tests/smoke.mjs` green (zero console errors + the rig still
animates). The **human** judges seam-gone folds, silhouette parity, cupping/iridescence on the
PR preview — headless tools can't see motion or folded-pose seams. For a detail tier:
`tricount --max=6000 --ci` at LOW and ULTRA → exit 0; detail must map tier2→LOW and never
*raise* under sustained low FPS.

### Strategy + risks
Coexist → prove on a hero → migrate (done for the hero — now mechanize the roster). Risks:
rig-contract drift (keep `'membrane'` as the untouched fallback until each dragon is proven);
tri budget / draw calls (`tricount --ci`; `mergeGeometries` from `../lib/utils/
BufferGeometryUtils.js` for same-material detail); rebuild thrash (4s gate, menus/death only);
save compat for the detail setting (`modelDetail` deep-merge default, no migration).

## THE RULE (do this every time)

1. **Read this file first.** It is the accumulated state of the art for this repo.
2. **After every meaningful change, append a ledger entry — and don't stop at the
   lesson. Interrogate it.** A recorded lesson is dead weight; the leapfrog only
   happens when you *brainstorm what it means for the future*. Every entry MUST answer:
   what did we learn → **how do we systematize the problem and the solution** → **what
   does this unlock / what's the next innovation it points to.** No forward-looking
   reflection = no leapfrog. (See the entry template below.)
3. **Build systems, not one-offs.** If a fix can become a reusable, tested,
   documented system, make it one. The next creature/feature should be *cheaper and
   better* than the last. If it can't be expressed as a system, it isn't done.
4. **Coexist → prove on a hero → migrate.** Never break the shipped roster. New tech
   ships as a new registered builder, is proven on one creature, then rolled out.
5. **Verify before you claim.** Run the headless tests + `tricount`; render with
   `tiershots` (real-WebGL compile check); the *human* judges motion/feel on the PR
   preview — our headless tools can't see animation or folded-pose seams.

### Ledger entry template (copy this for every entry)

```
### L# — <short title>
**Did / learned:** what we changed and the concrete lesson/gotcha.
**→ Systematize:** how the PROBLEM generalises (where else does it lurk?) and how the
  SOLUTION becomes a reusable system/pattern/test — so this class of bug/feature is
  solved once, forever.
**→ Leapfrog (innovate):** what this unlocks. The next idea it points to, the bigger
  capability it makes cheap, the thing we should now attempt *because* of this lesson.
```

The `→ Leapfrog` line is the whole point: it is where one session hands the next a
*running start* instead of a transcript.

## How we work (durable principles)

- **Puppet → organism.** Don't build creatures as separate visible pieces rotating
  on pivots that independently guess where to go — they collide/overlap/poke through.
  Derive *everything* (surface, bones, veins, edge glow, motion) from **one rig**.
- **Procedural & asset-free.** 100% code, vanilla Three.js r160, no build step, no
  texture/model files. Must hold **60fps on weak mobile** (3-tier adaptive system).
- **The rig contract is sacred.** `dragon.js` destructures specific handles
  (`wingPivotL/R, wingTipL/R, tipMarkerL/R, head, tailSegs, …`) and writes only
  `.rotation` on them + reads `tipMarker` world position. New handles are **additive
  and nullable** (the `none`-wings module is the template). Never rename/restructure.
- **Data over code.** A creature's character should be a *blueprint* it declares
  (parts, surfaces, shaders, flap profile), resolved by shared builders — not bespoke
  code. Migrating/adding creatures then approaches zero new code.

## The creature framework (current architecture, all in `reforged/js/`)

The compounding seam is the **recipe/registry + attach contract**: declare data →
resolve via a registry → one generic builder consumes it.

- **Recipe/blueprint** — `dragonRecipe.js` (`registerTorso/Wings/Head/Tail`,
  `resolveRecipe` infers a legacy blueprint from old flags so the roster is
  byte-identical). `dragonModel.js` orchestrates + dispatches via the registry.
- **Surface shader system** — `dragonSurfaceShader.js`: composable, asset-free
  MeshStandard patches (`fresnelRimPatch`, `cellularScales`, `iridescence`,
  `membraneSSS`) stacked via `composeSurface` (ONE `onBeforeCompile`, ONE merged
  `customProgramCacheKey`). `surface.js`'s rim delegates to it. Opt in per dragon via
  `parts.surface.shader`.
- **Curved membrane primitive** — `dragonParts.js#buildCurvedPatch`: smooth (span×
  chord) grid resampled from a wing outline; spanwise arc + chordwise billow + smooth
  normals. Replaces flat bent sheets.
- **Skinned continuous wing** — `dragonWings.js` `skinnedMembrane` recipe: ONE
  continuous `SkinnedMesh` on a **shoulder→elbow→wrist** bone skeleton; the rig
  handles ARE the bones. Surface ribs (leading edge, finger veins, trailing glow) are
  *sampled from the membrane surface* and skinned to the same skeleton → they bend
  with it, no poke-through. `buildSkinnedRibs` + `skinnedTube` + `spanSkin` weights.
- **Flap animation system** — `dragonWingFlap.js#flapWing`: phase-lagged
  shoulder→elbow→wrist cascade (the whip) + anatomical angle limits, **data-driven**
  by `model.flapProfile`. Driven from both the live rig (`dragon.js`) and the shop
  preview (`dragonModel.js#makePreviewTick`).
- **Adaptive quality** — `main.js applyQuality` + a 3-tier system; `tricount` budgets.

## Verification playbook

- `node reforged/tests/run-all.mjs` — full headless suite (uses `tools/three-resolver`
  + a DOM shim to build geometry with no renderer).
- `node reforged/tools/tricount.mjs [--ci] [--max=N]` — per-form triangle budget
  (ceiling 6000). Surface tubes are pricey — downsample centrelines.
- `node reforged/tools/tiershots.mjs <dragon>` — renders to `/tmp/tier-<d>.png`; logs
  `PAGEERROR` → the real-WebGL compile/skinning check. Rest pose only.
- `node reforged/tests/smoke.mjs` — boots the game in a browser, asserts zero console
  errors + the rig animates (default dragon = azure, non-skinned).
- **The human verifies motion + folded-pose seams on the PR preview** — we cannot.

## Feel knobs (wing motion → personality)

- **Beat speed** (`flapBias`/`flapSpeed`): faster = light/nimble/small; slower =
  majestic/massive.
- **Beat amplitude** (`flapAmp`): bigger = powerful/effortful; smaller = effortless glide.
- **Whip / lag** (`flapProfile.lagElbow/lagWrist/elbowAmp`): MORE lag = alive, elastic,
  weighty (sells *mass*); LESS = stiff/mechanical. *The lag is what sells weight.*
- **Per-form strength** (`model.formLevel` 0..3): scale flap strength so a Hatchling
  feels weaker than an Eternal.

# Lessons ledger (append newest at the bottom)

### L1 — Wings: derive everything from one rig, or it pokes through
**Did / learned:** Wings built as separate pieces (membrane panels + rigid bone rods +
edge ribs) rotating on pivots collide — straight rods poke through a folding membrane
("spokes"), panels overlap. Fix the technique, don't camouflage it (the Phoenix only
*hid* the same hinge under feathers). Make the wing ONE continuous surface and derive
the bones/veins/rim *from that surface* + skin them to the same skeleton.
**→ Systematize:** the general law is **"one source of truth per coordinated part."**
Anything that must stay registered to a deforming surface (scales, fins, frills, armour
plates, spikes, runes, attached FX) should be *generated from that surface and bound to
the same rig*, never authored in a parallel space. Make a reusable "decorate a surface"
helper (sample grid + offset normal + copy skin weights) — we already have `skinnedTube`;
generalise it to `skinnedDecal`/`shingleOnSurface`.
**→ Leapfrog:** if every add-on is surface-derived, a creature's *entire* look becomes
layers over one skinned hull → the Shingle system (scales=feathers=plates) and the
Phoenix's feathers-as-a-layer fall out for free, and "torn/wet/armoured" variants are
just different surface layers. This is the path to many creatures from one hull.

### L2 — SkinnedMesh in Three.js, the gotchas that bit us
**Did / learned:** (a) make the **rig handles the bones** so the existing `.rotation`
writes drive the skin on the GPU at ~0 CPU with no rig-contract change; (b) **bind in
local space** (assemble on a mount at origin → `updateMatrixWorld` → `bind` → *then* set
`mount.position`; baking the world offset in double-applies it); (c) multiple
`SkinnedMesh`es can **share one `Skeleton`**; (d) `frustumCulled = false`; (e) keep to a
few bones (mobile uniform/bone-texture limits).
**→ Systematize:** wrap this into a `buildSkinnedRig(bones, meshes)` helper so nobody
re-derives the bind dance — the gotchas become impossible to hit. A creature then says
"here are my bones + skinned parts" and binding/limits/culling are handled.
**→ Leapfrog:** with skinning trivial, the whole creature (body + neck + tail + limbs)
can be ONE skinned hull on a procedural skeleton — retiring the CPU pivot/segment loops
in `dragon.js` and unlocking high-poly bodies that animate free on the GPU (the Deform
rung). Also opens `AnimationMixer` clips and physics-driven bones later.

### L3 — Procedural grids: never clamp columns onto a seam
**Did / learned:** clamping out-of-panel grid columns onto one x made **zero-area
(degenerate) triangles** → NaN normals → shading spikes. Distribute columns across each
panel's real span (`spanStart/spanEnd`). Guarded by a no-degenerate-triangle test.
**→ Systematize:** "degenerate geometry = silent corruption" is a *class* of bug. Add a
reusable `assertCleanGeometry(geo)` (no zero-area tris, finite normals, weights sum to 1)
and run it in every geometry test — every future procedural mesh is validated by default.
**→ Leapfrog:** a trustworthy geometry validator lets us push *much* more aggressive
procedural generation (subdivision, marching-cubes blobs, parametric horns/frills)
without fear — the validator catches the corruption class for us, so we can be bold.

### L4 — Shader patches must compose, not overwrite
**Did / learned:** `onBeforeCompile` is a single slot; the original rim overwrote it +
hard-set the cache key, so nothing could stack. `composeSurface` chains all patches into
ONE `onBeforeCompile` + ONE merged `customProgramCacheKey`.
**→ Systematize:** the pattern is **"composable injectors over a shared extension
point."** Same shape applies to vertex deformers (`composeDeform`), post-fx, and any
GLSL we splice — build them all as `{key, pars, body, uniforms}` descriptors so they
compose by construction and cache-key correctly.
**→ Leapfrog:** a library of stackable patches → looks become *combinatorial* (P patches
= 2^P appearances) at ~zero authoring cost. Iridescent + scaled + subsurface + frost +
ember are mix-and-match per blueprint → huge visual variety from a tiny patch set.

### L5 — Motion is data: the whip = phase-lagged cascade + limits
**Did / learned:** a uniform sine on every joint looks mechanical; real wings cascade
(shoulder leads → elbow → wrist trails = the whip). Built `flapWing` as a reusable,
`flapProfile`-driven animator (lag/amp/limits per joint). Feel: **lag sells weight, speed
sells size, amplitude sells power.** Per-form `strength` scales the beat (Hatchling weak →
Eternal strong). Drive from BOTH the live rig and `makePreviewTick`.
**→ Systematize:** generalise "phase-lagged cascade along a bone chain" beyond wings —
it's the same engine for tails, necks, tongues, tentacles, antennae. One
`driveChain(bones, phase, profile)` animates any articulated appendage; named profiles
(`nimble`/`heavyDragon`/`glider`/`birdLike`) become a shared vocabulary.
**→ Leapfrog:** motion-as-data means a creature's *personality* is a blueprint field.
Per-dragon + per-form profiles give 16 dragons distinct "feels" for free, and the player
*feels* mass/agility from the rear camera — character differentiation at zero code cost.
Next: a `creatureMotionProfile` covering all appendages, then physics/wind response.

### L6 — Verification: tools see geometry, only the human sees motion
**Did / learned:** headless tests + `tricount` + `tiershots` (no `PAGEERROR` = compiles
in real WebGL) catch build/compile/budget regressions and *rest-pose* silhouette — but
**cannot** show animation or fold artifacts. Every "still see the spokes" round was a
folded-pose artifact invisible to our tools. Surface tubes are tri-heavy (we blew the
6000 ceiling — downsample + re-check).
**→ Systematize:** close the gap — add a `posedshot` tool that renders the dragon at a
few *forced* flap/fold phases (drive the rig to fixed poses, screenshot) so folded-pose
artifacts become catchable headlessly. Turn the manual human-in-the-loop into an
automated regression net for the class of bug that kept recurring.
**→ Leapfrog:** automated posed renders → a visual diff harness → we can refactor the
wing/motion systems fearlessly and catch regressions before the human ever sees them,
collapsing the slow "ship → human spots it → fix" loop that cost us several rounds.

### L7 — Per-form feel + the studio identity
**Did / learned:** scaled wing-beat `strength` by the stamped `model.formLevel` (0..3) so
a Hatchling flaps weaker than an Eternal — growth you *feel*, not just see. Studio named
**Leapfrog Studios** (`leapfrog^leapfrog`); this ledger is its core ritual. Critical
refinement to the ritual: **a lesson without a "systematize + innovate" reflection isn't
leapfrogging** — hence the `→ Systematize` / `→ Leapfrog` fields now mandatory above.
**→ Systematize:** "scale a trait by a normalized life-stage factor" generalises — body
mass, voice/SFX pitch, FX intensity, even AI aggression can all read `formLevel`. Make a
shared `formCurve(model, lo, hi)` so every per-form ramp is declared, not hand-coded.
**→ Leapfrog:** if form is a single normalized driver, an entire creature can *grow* on
one parameter — proportions, motion, colour, FX, sound all keyed to it. Ascension becomes
a felt arc (frail whelp → titan), and new creatures get the whole growth story for free.

### L8 — Differentiation must be WIDE and multi-cue; perfect the hero before migrating
**Did / learned:** the first per-form scale (strength 0.68→1.0) was too subtle — Hatchling
and Eternal "felt the same." A *felt* difference needs a **wide gap** AND **multiple
complementary cues**: widened strength to 0.42→1.0 *and* added speed 1.18→1.0, so a
Hatchling reads fast-but-feeble (frantic baby) and an Eternal slow-but-powerful (titan).
One subtle lever is invisible; two opposed cues over a wide range sell it. Process call
(user): **get ALL the graphical/modeling work perfect on the ONE hero (Obsidian) first,
THEN write the migration rules** — don't roll half-tuned tech across 16 dragons.
**→ Systematize:** (1) make a reusable `formCurve(model, lo, hi)` and prefer a *visible*
range — when a value is felt, default to a bold spread and let tuning pull it back, not
the reverse. (2) Codify "perfect-the-hero → extract a written migration checklist → roll
out" as the standard rollout: the hero IS the spec; migration becomes mechanical rule-
following, not re-derivation. The migration rules themselves become a ledger artifact.
**→ Leapfrog:** a written "Obsidian → any dragon" migration checklist (which recipe keys
to set, which model fields, how to pick a flap profile, what to verify) turns roster-wide
rollout into a near-zero-thought batch — and is the template for migrating *every* future
system (surface, shingle, deform) hero-first. Perfecting one creature fully then
mechanizing the spread is the fastest safe path to a whole polished roster.

### L9 — The shop preview is a SECOND render context; own its fidelity separately
**Did / learned:** the inspect showcase looked flat/ugly for three compounding reasons,
all about render *context*, not the model: (1) the preview cameras rendered **layer 0
only**, so every plasma sprite (core glow, aura, halos) — authored on **layer 1** to sit
out of the in-game water reflection — was **invisible in the shop**. A sprite's layer is
a *per-context* decision; adding a new camera (preview/minimap/reflection) means
auditing which layers it should see. (2) No post-processing → emissive eyes/edges never
*glowed*. (3) The always-on-top **aim-marker** crystal (a chase-cam HUD aid) rendered as
an ugly nub on the snout when the showcase faced the dragon. Then the *first* fix
over-corrected: strong bloom **stacked** with additive corona + floor + a bright stage
centre → the dragon became a **silhouette against a white sun**. Bloom is multiplicative
over additive sprites; keep the stage DARK + front-light the hero, bloom is a
high-threshold *accent*, never base brightness.
**→ Systematize:** treat **preview vs gameplay as a first-class fidelity seam**. The
`opts.preview` flag on `buildDragonModel` already gates preview-only choices (drop the
aim marker, tame the corona) — lean on it: the shop is an isolated scene/renderer, so
spend there (bloom, lit glow, a themed backdrop) with **zero gameplay-budget cost** and
**strip** anything that exists only for gameplay readability. The new
`showcaseBackdrop.js` (themed sky gradient + drifting motes + vignette, coloured by the
dragon's aura) is a reusable "hero on a stage" system — any unlock/celebration/victory
surface can reuse it. Rule of thumb: **bright additive + bloom = washout**; dark stage +
front key light + high-threshold bloom = the hero pops.
**→ Leapfrog:** with a context-aware fidelity seam + a themed-backdrop system, the shop
can chase AAA gacha quality (character-select stages per biome, particles, post,
dramatic lighting) while gameplay stays lean — the two contexts evolve independently.
Next: theme the backdrop by the dragon's **biome** (the world we fly through, not just
its aura), add foreground depth motes, and a **hero camera angle** (¾-front) so the face
greets the player — then this becomes the template for every "admire your unlock" moment.

### L10 — A menu is the real world, reframed — never a reinvented one
**Did / learned:** the shop/menu cost ~20 rounds because of two opposite mistakes. First
I reused the gameplay scene but **mutated the run** to make it menu-like — ~35 "menuMode"
hacks (teleport the player into a biome, toggle obstacle/ring/ember visibility, override
the render gate). That entanglement *was* the bug parade: walls vanished, embers leaked,
the dragon froze in its crash pose, the player desynced. Then I over-corrected by **hand-
rolling a separate "menu engine"** (a crude sky shader + box "pillars" + a bare Reflector)
— which looked amateur, because it was a worse reinvention of an engine that's already
beautiful. What finally worked: render the **REAL environment pipeline** (the tuned sky +
shader water + god-rays + fog + post-FX) for the shop — *exactly what the start screen
already does* — overlay the HUD, and swap **only the dragon mesh** (`rebuildDragon`). The
bugs were never from reusing the scene; they were from mutating the *run state*. The
ugliness was never from "a separate engine"; it was from reinventing the renderer.
**→ Systematize:** the law is **"menu = the real game world, reframed + frozen, never
mutated."** For any showcase, REUSE the actual render pipeline (it's tuned, on-brand,
free) and overlay UI; the only thing you touch is the *subject* (the dragon), never the
world/run state. The decoupling that matters is **STATE** (don't modify the run), not
**RENDERING** (do reuse the engine). And reserve "invent" for the differentiating layer
(look/feel/composition); never re-derive the plumbing you already have.
**→ Leapfrog:** with "menu = reframed real world" locked, EVERY admire-your-unlock surface
(shop, ascension/unlock celebration, victory, character-select) reuses the one tuned
environment + a static hero camera + a swappable subject — near-zero new render code,
guaranteed beauty. Next: a data-driven per-surface camera/biome theme (e.g. force the
astral biome for the shop) and a clean "freeze the world" helper for the paused-mid-run
case — both pure additions over a foundation that can no longer break gameplay.

### L11 — Reskin only what's WIRED; a pivot leaves dead code that lies to you
**Did / learned:** Phase 3 was warming the leftover **cool-blue 2D UI chrome** (Pilot, shop
2D chrome, quests) to the shipped warm ember system (`--rf-*` tokens + the `.gx-card`
gilded-glass language + `.btn-*`/`.seg-btn` already on master). Settings turned out to be
**already 100% warm** (don't re-skin what's done — grep the tokens first). The trap: I
swept `style.css` for cool-blue selectors and warmed *all* of them — including the entire
`.inspect-*` / `.form-btn` / `.ins-*` / `.form-scrub` / `.stat-bar` blocks. But the
biome-pivot (L10) had **deleted the inspect showcase's entry point**: `openInspect()` is
still ~200 lines in `ui.js` but is **never called**, and `.inspect-btn` is no longer
rendered — so that CSS is **dead**. I'd spent a dozen edits styling code that never paints.
Caught only because the human asked "wasn't inspect removed?". Fix: `git checkout` the file
and re-apply **only the live edits** (the diff dropped from ~38 churned lines to a clean 19,
all live). **A grep of a stylesheet tells you what *exists*, not what's *reachable*.**
**→ Systematize:** before reskinning a class, confirm it's live — `grep -rn "class-name"
js/` and check the creator isn't itself dead (here: the classes existed only inside the
never-called `openInspect`). Verify against the *freshly-synced master* (this branch's old
shop-stage PR #103 was obsoleted by the pivot and hard-reset away first). Ship per-screen
commits, each with a headless screenshot over the **real biome backdrop** (warm chrome must
stay legible on the cool astral scene), re-stamping the SW each time. And **keep rarity/brand
accents** (`--haccent`/`--hrar`/`--accent`/`data-rarity`) — only neutralize *generic* cool
chrome; the rarity ladder (R green / SR blue / SSR purple / SSSR gold) is intentional.
**→ Leapfrog:** the warm system is now the single source for ALL chrome — new screens
inherit `--rf-*` + `.gx-card` + `.btn-*`/`.seg-btn` and are warm by default. **Open debt:**
the dead inspect showcase (`openInspect` + `.inspect-*`/`.form-btn`/`.ins-*`/`.form-scrub`/
`.stat-bar` CSS) should be deleted in a dedicated dead-code-removal pass — left in place this
session by choice, recorded here so a future session removes it deliberately.
